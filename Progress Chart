Progress Log

6/11/2021: Today I mainly just focused on watching Youtube videos and learned more about different languages and what it means to be a Software Engineer. 
           I also looked into resources to start my learning journey (Bootcamps, free online resources, etc.) I ended up deciding on Code Academy and
           got to work the next day!

6/12/2021: Today was a saturday, so I thought it would be a good day to get started on actually learning. I decided to do a Full-Stack Engineer Career Path on Code Academy.
           I coded for about 6 hours, it was a hot day so I decided it was best spent inside. Unfortunatly, my AC broke so it was a very hot inside too! I learned
           the introduction to JavaScript (Variables, Conditionals, And Functions). I had a little trouble with conditionals and quite a bit of trouble on funtions,
           but eventually I figured it out. I felt like I learned quite a bit for the day and headed to bed!
           
6/13/2021: I decided today was going to be a medium work day just because I grinded quite a bit yesterday. I decided I want to learn alot about the front-end before I really
           get into back-development. I also looked into how much people charge on UpWork and it was upwards of 35/hr. I thought that was pretty good and gave me a goal to
           strive torwards. I would like to make some personal websites before I charge, so I don't charge people for inadequate and poor work. I think i'm getting a little
           ahead of myself.
