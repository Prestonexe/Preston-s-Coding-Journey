Progress Log: This will track my progress from complete begineer to learning how to code. The date will be on the left and I will try to do two posts a day,
              once in the morning before I've done any coding, and once in the afternoon after I have finished coding for the day.



6/11/2021: Today I mainly just focused on watching Youtube videos and learned more about different languages and what it means to be a Software Engineer. 
           I also looked into resources to start my learning journey (Bootcamps, free online resources, etc.) I ended up deciding on Code Academy and
           got to work the next day! Note: I have zero coding experience.

6/12/2021: Today was a saturday, so I thought it would be a good day to get started on actually learning. I decided to do a Full-Stack Engineer Career Path on Code Academy.
           I coded for about 6 hours, it was a hot day so I decided it was best spent inside. Unfortunatly, my AC broke so it was a very hot inside too! I learned
           the introduction to JavaScript (Variables, Conditionals, And Functions). I had a little trouble with conditionals and quite a bit of trouble on funtions,
           but eventually I figured it out. I felt like I learned quite a bit for the day and headed to bed!
           
6/13/2021: I decided today was going to be a medium work day just because I grinded quite a bit yesterday. I decided I want to learn alot about the front-end before I really
           get into back-development. I also looked into how much people charge on UpWork and it was upwards of 35/hr. I thought that was pretty good and gave me a goal to
           strive torwards. I would like to make some personal websites before I charge, so I don't charge people for inadequate and poor work. I think i'm getting a little
           ahead of myself. Today I learned some array and started on loops. CodeAcademy has been super slow today and unresponsive so it's slowed down my progress.
           
6/14/2021: (Morning) I figured out yesterday why CodeAcademy was acting up. I was doing a loop but never stopping said loop, so it took alot of energy to do the task resulting in poor
                     performance. Today I am not as motivated as I would like, but I do want to finish up loops. I looked a little into HTML, and thought it would be interesting to learn.
                     I noticed it is a little later in my course though. I think I should have a rest day on Wednesday or Thursday. Still passionate but somewhat waning. Hope I can actually
                     start building things soon!
                     
         (Afternoon) I am struggling and have hit a roadblock when it comes to understanded for loops within nested arrays. I am thinking I will not be able to get through
                     as much today as I had previously. I think it will get harder as time goes on an I will get through less and less everyday. I just need to perservere and
                     get through and truly understand it!
